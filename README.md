# My Personal Money Tracker (Hands Off!)

Hello, dear self! Welcome to the README of your very own, super exclusive, not-for-sharing Money Tracker. It's like a diary, but for money and with less gossip. Remember, this is just for us - no peeking, everyone else!

<br />

### What's This Secretive App About?

This is our little corner of the digital world where we track our fabulous income and those pesky expenses. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS because, well, why not? Overkill is underrated.

<br />

### Features (My Eyes Only!)

-   **Income Tracker**: Where I watch my earnings crawl in. It's like a suspense movie, but slower.
-   **Expense Monitor**: A record of all the things I probably didn't need but definitely bought.🙂👌
-   **Current Balance**: It's like a mood ring for my wallet. Mostly blue.

<br />

### Contribution

Nope. Nada. Zilch. This is my personal finance tracker. If you're not me, kindly refrain from contributing, but feel free to be jealous.

<br />

### License

This project is as free as my spirit, but let's be real, it's just for me. No license needed for my private musings.

<br />

### Acknowledgments

-   To me, for being both the brains and the beauty behind this operation.
-   To my future self, for the inevitable 'thank you' for being so organized.
-   Coffee and late nights, the unsung heroes of this coding adventure.
